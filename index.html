          <h3>About</h3>
						Hello! My name is Eddrich Janzzen Ang, but you can call me Janzzen. I am a software engineer who loves to code, read books, and explore new technologies. I also enjoy spending time around nature because it's a nice opportunity to unwind, destress, and clear my mind. 
          	<br><br>

          <h3>Experience</h3>
        		As a developer, I have experience working with different technology platforms such as Web Apps, Databases, and Cloud providers. I have experience using different application development frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Python Django</a>, <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Python Flask</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET</a>. For frontend development, I have used frameworks such as <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> to develop simple user interfaces.


        		<br><br>
        		One aspect of software engineering I am very passionate about is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a>. I enjoy building pipelines and automating tasks in order to speed up development and alleviate the bottle necks.
